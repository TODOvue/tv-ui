### Added
- Included the `src` directory in the `package.json` files list to ensure component source files are bundled in the package distribution.

### Removed

## [1.1.1] - 2025-12-19

### Added
- Added automatic publishing to the TODOvue cPanel in `release.yml` for each release, simplifying package distribution and updates.
- Added `package-lock.json` to the repository to ensure dependency consistency and facilitate version management across development and production environments.

### Changed
- Changed the `base` option in `vite.config.js` for website deployment in cpanel.

### Fixed
- Fixed repository URL in `package.json` to point to the correct GitHub repository.
- Fixed the token configuration used to generate the package in the GitHub Actions workflow `release.yml`.

### Dependencies
- Updated dependency versions in `package.json` to maintain compatibility and benefit from improvements and bug fixes in the used libraries.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-11-21

### Added
- Added `nux.js` configuration file for Nuxt 4 integration.
- Added `tsconfig.json` for proper type checking during build.
- Create `global.d.ts` to declare module for TypeScript users.
- Added Nuxt module for automatic style injection and auto-registration of the `TvAlert` component.
- The `@todovue/tv-alert` component is now externalized from the final build, reducing bundle size.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **BREAKING FIX**: Exported `useAlert` composable from the library entry point (`src/entry.ts`). Previously, the composable was not accessible when importing from `@todovue/tv-alert`, causing errors when trying to use `import { useAlert } from '@todovue/tv-alert'`.
- Fixed incorrect imports in demo files that were importing from `@todovue/tv-button` instead of `@todovue/tv-alert`.

### Added
- Proper exports in both ESM and CJS bundles for `useAlert`.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-11-15

### Changed
- Styles are now served as a separate CSS file (`dist/tv-alert.css`) generated by Vite during the build process.
- Users must now explicitly import the stylesheet in their application:
  - For Vue/Vite SPA: `import '@todovue/tv-alert/style.css'` in `main.ts`
  - For Nuxt 3/4: Add `'@todovue/tv-alert/style.css'` to the `css` array in `nuxt.config.ts`

### Added
- Added `sideEffects` field to `package.json` to support proper tree-shaking with CSS files.
- Added `./style.css` export path in `package.json` for explicit CSS imports.
- Improved SSR/SSG compatibility, especially for Nuxt 3/4 applications.

### Dependencies
- Removed dependency on `vite-plugin-css-injected-by-js` from `devDependencies`
