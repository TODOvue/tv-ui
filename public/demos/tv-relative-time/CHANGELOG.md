## [1.2.1] - 2025-12-19

### Added

### Fixed

- Fixed the token configuration used to generate the package in the GitHub Actions workflow `release.yml`.

### Dependencies
- Updated dependency versions in `package.json` to maintain compatibility and benefit from improvements and bug fixes in the used libraries.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-11-21

### Added
- Added `tsconfig.json` for proper type checking during build.
- Create `global.d.ts` to declare module for TypeScript users.
- The `@todovue/tv-label` component is now externalized from the final build, reducing bundle size.
- Added `CHANGELOG.md` in script to generate demo and documentation site.

### Dependencies

## [1.1.2] - 2025-11-15

### Changed
- Removed CSS injection via `vite-plugin-css-injected-by-js` from the library build. Styles are now provided as a separate CSS file generated by Vite (`dist/*.css`) and must be explicitly imported in the host application (SPA or Nuxt).
- These changes improve compatibility with SSR/SSG environments, especially Nuxt 3/4, by avoiding runtime CSS injection.

## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-18

### Changed
- The library build now uses `src/entry.ts` (exports both the component and the plugin) instead of directly exporting the `.vue` file.
- CSS injection via JS has been removed for the library build (it is only kept for the demo), generating a `tv-relative-time.css` file optimized for SSR/Nuxt.
- Changed node-version to workflows release.yml to 20.

### Added
- Plugin installation support: `app.use(TvRelativeTime)` or `app.use(TvRelativeTimePlugin)`.
- Explicit export of the style file: `import '@todovue/tv-relative-time/style.css'`.
- Documentation for usage in SSR and Nuxt 3 applications.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-05-06

### Features
- Added localization support for relative time formatting (`es`, `fr`, `pt`, and `en` as default)

### Fixed
- Fixed date formatting issues by enforcing the UTC timezone
- Watched `date` and other props to ensure reactivity
- Updated package references and improved documentation consistency

## [1.0.0] - 2025-05-05

### Features
- Fully functional `<TvRelativeTime />` component.
- Live update support with customizable `updateInterval`.
- Compact mode via `compact` prop: displays formats like `2d`, `3w`, `1mo`, `1a`.
